f_response: "You can obtain $VLX on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) through AMMs like PancakeSwap, but how do you get it to Velas Chain? You will need to use a bridge to get your tokens inside Velas Chain. Bridging (nto be confused with swapping) is moving a token from one chain to another.\_Because the transactions occurs in 2 chains, this could take 10min ~ 24 hours, depending on the traffic."
