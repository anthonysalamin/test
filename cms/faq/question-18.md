  Neither Velas, nor Multichain, nor Wavelength will offer any migration
  services for wrapped assets. If you happen to own wrapped assets on Velas that
  were NOT ISSUED by Multichain and wish to use Wavelength, you must either: 1)
  Bridge other assets from different networks via Multichain; 2) Bridge your
  wrapped assets back to the original networks and then rebridge to Velas via
  the Multichain bridge.

  How do I migrate from the old wrapped assets to the new Multichain wrapped
  assets?
