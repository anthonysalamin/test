  Wavelength pools are permissionless, meaning anyone can create a liquidity
  pool with any token and weights (for example, 60%$VLX - 40%$USDC or 90%$VLX -
  10% USDC), allowing users to choose how much exposure they want to have to
  each of the tokens in the pool when providing liquidity. To create a pool, you
  need to go to Wavelength’s website => “Pools” => “Compose a Pool”.
