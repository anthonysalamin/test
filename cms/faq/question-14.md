  Swapping tokens on Wavelength is a very similar experience to that of other
  protocols alike. In other words, it is effortless. If you have never used an
  AMM Dex, follow the steps: 1) Connect your desktop or mobile wallet to
  Wavelength by clicking on the “Connect Wallet” on the top right button;

  2) Select the two assets you want to swap. On top is the one you are selling,
  and on the bottom is the buying one;

  3) Input the amount you wish to buy;

  4) Check the slippage and the minimum received of the token you’re buying. The
  less slippage you suffer, the more you will receive;

  5) Click the “swap” button on the bottom of the swap interface;

  6) Make sure to have enough $VLX in your wallet to pay the gas fee and sign
  the transaction.

  7) Now just wait a couple of seconds for your transaction to be confirmed
  (your wallet should notify you);

  8) And that is it! Your swap is successful!
