  On Wavelength’s website, go to the “Pools” section, and you will see the list
  of incentivized pools. You can provide liquidity by depositing any of the
  Liquidity Pool's assets or all them at once. When withdrawing, you can
  withdraw the funds split across all the assets in the pool or in the form of a
  single asset of the pool of your choice.
